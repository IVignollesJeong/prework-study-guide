# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This study guide webpage was created to be a study guide to reference throughout coding lessons as well as serving as a lesson in itself to create. The webpage contains valuable notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript as well as links to more resources on said topics. Through the process of creating the webpage, extensive knowledge was gained on the process of creating the HTML framework, styling the page using CSS, adding functions and logic through JavaScript, and ultimately gaining familiarity with the GitHub work flow or "GitFlow".
