          <li>HTML is the foundation to the house (website).</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible conten shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Elements use opening and closing tags to insert content into the webpage.</li>
          <li>These elements include h1-6 for headers, p for paragraphs, ul/ol/li for lists</li>
          <li>Many more elements exist. More information on these elements can be found <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/csp/cs21/htmlcheatsheet.pdf">here!</a></li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>The * selector applies the styling rules to ALL elements.</li>
          <li>Three ways to style using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>Inline is embedded within the code line and styles just that line of code.</li>
          <li>Internal is embedded within the HTML file using a style element and only apply to that page.</li>
          <li>External is a separate file that is linked to the HTML code. Use this to have more control/cleaner code. (Separation of concerns)</li>
          <li>CSS consists of a selector and declarations. The declarations consist of a property and a value.</li>
          <li>A selector selects which element or attribute to apply the style rules (the property and value) to.</li>
          <li>A property is the kind of style we want to apply (ex: color, text-align).</li>
          <li>A value is the description of the property we are applying (ex: blue, justify).</li>
          <li>EXTERNAL CSS: you must link the .css to the HTML to see changes.</li>
          <li>linking consists of the link element (link) relationship between documents (rel="") and reference to said document (href="").</li>
          <li>Use . then the class name (ex: section class="card") to style that class. (ex: .card to style the card sections in our HTML).</li>

          <li>A VARIABLE is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>CONTROL FLOW is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>ARRAYS are single variables that are used to hold a group of data.</li>
          <li>Data within arrays are indexed, meaning each data point is assigned a number.</li>
          <li>Arrays are zero-indexed and sequential, meaning they start at zero and increase by 1 each data point (ex:0,1,2,3,...).</li>
          <li>LOOPS use predictable patterns of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array.</li>
          <li>An example of a loop is a for loop. The for loop uses predictable patterns of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array.</li>
          <li>The for loop does this by executing a code block over and over, only being interrupted conditional statements such as if statements.</li>
          <li>The for loop contains three important statements: starting point of loop (ex: var x = 0;), condition (ex: x less than shapes.length;), and iteration (ex: x++).</li>
          <li>A for loop would look like this: for(var x = 0; x less than shapes.length; x++) { code block }.</li>
          <li>The code block could be something like printing the data on the console (ex: console.log(shapes[x]);</li>
          <li>A FUNCTION is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>Declare a function then follow with a unique name which will be used to call the function (ex: function helloWorld() {console.log("Hello World I am a function")}).</li>
          <li>The function name is always followed by closed parentheses which will later be filled with parameters we define.</li>
          <li>Within the curly brackets after the function lies the code block that will be executed when the function name is called.</li>
          <li>Ex: the code block console.log("Hello World I am a function") would be executed by writing helloWorld(), which would print "Hello World I am a function" in the console.</li>
